npm WARN deprecated @babel/polyfill@7.2.5: ��� This package has been deprecated in favor of separate inclusion of a polyfill and regenerator-runtime (when needed). See the @babel/polyfill docs (https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-polyfill) for more information.

Please, upgrade your dependencies to the actual version of core-js.
